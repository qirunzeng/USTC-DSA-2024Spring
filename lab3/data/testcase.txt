USUSTC
When I was in USTC, my dream was to study in USUSTC and get the highest GPA among USUSTCers.
But unfortunately, life played a joke on me. I was admitted to CSTC(College of Science and Technology of China).
Since then, I spared no effort to get a higher GPA. I study Quantum Mechanics day and night and finally found my place in USUSTC.
